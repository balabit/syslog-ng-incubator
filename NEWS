* 0.3.3 - <2014-07-25 Fri>

** Bugfix: Compatibility with syslog-ng 3.5.5

The newest syslog-ng release, syslog-ng 3.5.5 introduced a breaking
API change. The Incubator has been updated, and now works with - and
requires - at least syslog-ng 3.5.5.

** Bugfix: Fix for the ElasticSearch SCL plugin

The ElasticSearch SCL plugin has been fixed, and will now work out of
the box.

* 0.3.2 - <2014-07-15 Tue>

Larger bugfix release with several small features.

** Bugfix: Fixed getent template function compilation on FreeBSD. 
There was an unnecessary header file, which isn't present on FreeBSD.

** Feature: Added support for protocols in getent template function.
Getent template function can now resolve protocol names.

** Bugfix: Lua destination became a so-called threaded destination.
It has now a separate thread, and it prevents race conditions in multi-threaded
mode.

** Feature: Lua destination init parameters and queue parameters are reworked.
Globals are now constants as they should ever be. There is a new feature
with the params() option, which works exactly as the old globals(), eg.
uses value pairs, and templates can be used. The result is manifested as a lua
table as the second parameter of the queue func. Although the same result
can be achieved by using raw mode and Template class in Lua, using params
is more comfortable in some cases (eg: SCL).

** Bugfix: Perl destination driver has a separate thread.
This prevents reace conditions like in Lua.

** Feature: Graphite SCL is added.
This allows a brand new graphite destination on top of tcp() driver
and graphite-output template function.

** Bugfix: Consolidated --enable-* configure parameters.
They are now working similarly, yes means that if configure doesn't find
the depending lib, it fails, auto means, that if configure doesn't find the
depending lib, it disables the feature, and no means configure simply disables the 
feature. The only exception is python.

** Feature: Python version autodetection.
--with-python switch has now the following options: no: disables python 
related modules; auto: autodetects python version, disables python modules 
if not found; force: autodetects python version, fails if not found;
python-<version>: forces specified version, fails if not found.

* 0.3.1 - <2014-06-02 Mon>
 
** Bugfix: Fixed linkage of modules 
All modules were accidentally linked to libperl, now only 
perl destination module is linked to libperl.

** Bugfix: Fixed rss module linkage. 
It wasn't linked to libsyslog-ng.so.

* 0.3.0 - <2014-05-28 Wed>

New scripted destinations are introduced by algernon 
<algernon@madhouse-project.org>: Python and Perl. Additionally
several bugfixes, small features and the getent template function are
introduced.

** Feature: Python and Perl destination

These destinations are very similar to the current Lua destination,
except that their queue method get a dict (or hash in Perl) as a parameter.

** Feature: getent template function.

Getent template function can query information from the system user databases.
For example it can convert uid to username and can get other fields from
user databases.

** Feature: Graphite output timestamp now configurable as a template.

** Feature: Padding template function allows user to pad a string to a specified width.

** Bugfix: Fixed float casting in Riemann destination

** Bugfix: Fixed an error messsage in + template function.

* 0.2.1 - <2014-03-12 Wed>

This is a bug fix only release over the previous 0.2.0 version, with
the following changes:

** Bugfix: FreeBSD portability

The Incubator can now be compiled on FreeBSD!

** Bugfix: Improved Lua detection

On some systems, the Lua pkg-config file is called lua-5.1, or
lua-5.2, not lua5.1/lua5.2. The configure script was taught to
recognise all of these.

** Bugfix: Fixed a crash in the Lua destination

When using the Lua destination without globals() being present does
not crash the module anymore.

* 0.2.0 - <2014-02-26 Wed>

Most of the features of this release are contributed by Viktor Tusa
<tusa@balabit.hu>, many thanks for them!

** Feature: LuaJIT support
When configured with --enable-luajit, and LuaJIT is available, it is
now possible to build the Lua destination against that version of Lua.

** Feature: monitor source
This new source is somewhere between the trigger() source and the
lua() destination, in that it allows one to write a Lua function that
gets periodically executed, and can produce a log message.

** Feature: Templating support for the Lua destination
Destinations written in Lua can now use Templates, from within the
Lua code itself. Most useful for raw mode.

** Feature: Lua destinations have easy access to the timestamps
The Lua destination now makes another function available:
Message.get_timestamp(), that gets one the UNIX timestamp in integer
format, without having to format it first with a template, and then
converting it back.

** Feature: The Lua modules now have a deinit hook
In case the destination needs to do something at deinit time, there
is now a deinit hook.

** Feature: The Lua modules has access to logging functions
It is now possible to use syslogng.debug, syslogng.error,
syslogng.info and syslogng.verbose functions from within Lua, to
construct internal log messages.

** Feature: The Lua destination can have global variables set
It is now possible to set global variables (strings and ints) from
within the syslog-ng configuration file, that get passed down to the
Lua destination.

** Feature: graphite output template function
This template function, with syntax much like that of $(format-json)
allows one to easily forward data to a Graphite server, when combined
with the tcp() destination.

** Feature: An ElasticSearch SCL
The Incubator now ships with an SCL file, and a helper program that
makes it possible to easily send events to ElasticSearch, in a
Kibana-compatible format.

** Bugfix: RSS destination does not require newer glib
The RSS destination used features not available in the glib version
targeted by the Incubator. It was fixed to work with the older
version we target.

* 0.1.1 - <2014-01-24 Fri>

** Bugfix: Grammar files are not shipped in the tarball anymore
When generating a tarball with "make dist", the built grammar files
are not shipped anymore. They're built against a specific syslog-ng
version, and as such, are not portable to another version of it. The
grammars need to be rebuilt, and shipping them prevents that.

** Bugfix: Don't depend on recent glib
When glib is too old, the $(state) template function gets disabled
now, instead of the build failing.

** Feature: Lua destination
This new feature allows one to write destination driver scripts in
Lua. Example scripts are provided in modules/lua/.

* 0.1.0 - <2013-12-28 Sat>

Initial public release.
